Free Code Camp's Color Markers project is to learn how to use colors in CSS.

Things I learned:
1. Div contents will be there but will not appear on a webpage if there is no content in it. Unless, you specify it CSS to different styles.
2. There are shorthand properties (margin) where one or two values can be provided to shorthand values for all the properties (margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-right, margin-left).
3. More classes can be given to an element by just putting space on the class attribute and specifying the next class (class="markers red")
4. Two main color models: additive RGB (red, color, gree) and subtractive CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black). In this project, the RGB model is used using the rgb() function. Each red, green, blue number is a number from 0 to 255.
